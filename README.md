# Plugin README Parser

<img src="https://ps.w.org/wp-readme-parser/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">WordPress README files are formatted using a version of the Markdown language. This plugin can be used to convert these to XHTML and display on a post or page of your site.

It's ideal for plugin developers who wish to add instructions to their own site without having to duplicate effort.

**Note:**
**This plugin will no longer be updated, other than for critical security issues. During December 2024, it will be formally closed.**
**[Find out more here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/important-please-read-before-posting-6/), including, if you’re a developer, how you can adopt it.**

Features include...

* Convert your markdown README to XHTML and display in any post or page
* Use shortcodes or a direct PHP function call
* Responsive output of screenshots
* Output is cached for maximum performance
* Links automatically added to author and tag information
* Download links added
* Ability to specify which sections of the readme to exclude
* Can also omit specific lines of text
* Extra shortcodes available to display plugin banners and to return specific plugin data (download link, version number, etc)
* Google Translation suppressed on code output
